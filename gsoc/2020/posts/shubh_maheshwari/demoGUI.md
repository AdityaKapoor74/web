## Evaluation dataset to testing the module 
We have created a small database, [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15Z6ZSVA_cbcK_QEBG4Ovu7oiXQiPXOfO?usp=sharing).

To evaluate:  
1. Each person will have 3 videos. (Preferably walking)
2. Store data from 1 video and evaluate on other videos.
