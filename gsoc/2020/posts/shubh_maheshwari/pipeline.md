**System diagram for communication between robocomp components. Given input video or real-time camera feed, first we would track person in the video. For each person we would get the face features and gait features. Next we will fuse the features and search the database. Finally we will return the label**

<!-- ## Late Fusion for face & gait features 


## Creating Database 
  We have a seperate database for face & gait. Each stores extracted features of a person in an h5py format

## Creating Gallery
