# GSoC'20 RoboComp project: Software agent for estimating occupancy in medium and large buildings using RGB cameras

 
## About me

I am Nivedita Rufus. I am an active researcher and very passionate about Robotics. So, owing to my passion I primarily work with ‘Self-Driving Cars’ which is also part of my research work at IIIT- Hyderabad, India. I am delighted to be part of the GSoC'20 programe at RoboComp.

## About the Project

Humans and robots coexist together in today's world and to make these interactions more meaningful, one of the capacities that a robot must certainly perform is to understand the people it is interacting with human beings, and sometimes the knowledge of how many people the robot needs to interact with becomes crucial information.  
The aim of this project is to add upon the existing functionalities of the ‘People Counter’ in the ‘Human Detection Component’ allowing a more enriched interaction between robots and humans. This will allow the robot to make better decisions based on the density of people present in the area. This [blog](https://niveditarufus.github.io/) also goes into grat detail of all work I have done so far in my GSoC Journey.
