## It is a wrap !!

I feel so good at the same time a little disappointed that my GSoC 2020 journey is in the wrap-up phase. It was my privilege to work for RoboComp. I started out not knowing much, but in these three months, the amount of learning that happened was exponential. This is probably the most productive summer I have ever had. You can find my contributions to RoboComp [here](https://github.com/niveditarufus/human-detection/tree/gsoc). I would like to thank my mentors who have been supportive and approachable throughout this journey making it an incredible one. I hope I have delivered what I had proposed. This [blog](https://niveditarufus.github.io/) also goes into great detail of all work I have done in my GSoC journey and also touches upon the possible future extensions.
