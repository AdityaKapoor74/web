# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go. The Lane lines on the road that shows us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle. Naturally, one of the first things I would like to do in this project is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

In this project I detect lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV and later on video.  OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many useful tools for analyzing images.  
Some steps include :-
1. Convert BGR image to Gray
2. Convert into Blurred image using Gaussian Filter(to avoid the noise)
3. Apply Canny Edge Detection into the image.
4. we define Region of interest(i.e. bottom half of th image)
5. Apply Hough Transform and smoothing the final detected lane lines.
