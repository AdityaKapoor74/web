# Gazebo-RoboComp: Demo Scenarios

In this post I will talk about all the demo scenarios that I have made for the gazebo-robocomp integration. Some I have ported from robocomp and some are completely original.

In total there are in total 6 scenarios that I chose to port in gazebo. So, here is a demo of all the scenarios that are ported:

The process was not very complex. Gazebo provides a number of elementary models which can be used to make more complex environment scenarios. In all of the above scenarios these elementary models, provided by gazebo, are used. So, there are walls, tables, chairs, boxes, signs, etc.
