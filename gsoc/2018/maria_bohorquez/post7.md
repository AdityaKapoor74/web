# Frequently Asked Questions for Robocomp

For questions or help for other GSoC students (or anyone really!), contact me at gabriellabohorquez@gmail.com or robocomp.team@gmail.com

## Why a FAQ?

- Seeing the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/robocomp/robocomp/robocomp-gsoc) you can see some of the same questions are repeated very often. People ask about how to contribute, how to install Robocomp, etc. I wanted to have a page you can suggest to them.

- Updating and rewriting the docs made me realize something, Robocomp docs cover a lot (!) of information. So doing a little summary and telling people where to find answers it's a good idea.

## Thinking about what questions to answer

I started wirh the basics: How to contribute? How to install Robocomp? I want to help! What do I do? In which branch should I make changes?

Then I added some more: What is Robocomp? What is the Learnbot? How to use other OS? How should you file an Issue?

I am still adding questions even now. This is how it looks right now:

When I finish the last two questions I'm adding it to the main page of the Repo (Readme.md).
