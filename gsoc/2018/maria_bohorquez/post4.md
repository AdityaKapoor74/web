For questions or help for other GSoC students (or anyone really!), contact me at gabriellabohorquez@gmail.com or robocomp.team@gmail.com  

## Learning about how to write User-friendly Documentation

Writing good documentation is the core of making projects more friendly for more members of the community. Writing documentation that is inclusive, for a global audience and answer questions that may arise it’s a challenge.

Having a way to contact the team for help it’s a start. That’s why robocomp.team@gmail.com was created.

As reference about creating developer documentation I chose [Google’s style guide](https://developers.google.com/style/). It explains general principles as well as grammar rules, naming conventions, formatting tips and more.

All the tutorials that already existed in the [/doc](https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp/tree/highlyunstable/doc) folder were checked out and updated. Priority was given into improving reading flow, expanding explanations and checking that all of the code was working.

## Writing a Script to install Robocomp

It was pointed out to me that the installation process for Robocomp was too long and could be automated. I started to write a bash script to solve this problem.

It gives options to download Robocomp with FLC support (part of this already existed [here](https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp/blob/highlyunstable/doc/install-robocomp-dev.sh)). I took tips from a [Bash Scripting UX Guide](https://codeburst.io/13-tips-tricks-for-writing-shell-scripts-with-awesome-ux-19a525ae05ae) to make it as good looking as I could.

This is part of how it looks for now:

When I finish testing the script, it's time to make new tutorials!
