# RoboComp- Javascript support

May 5, 2018

## About me

My name is José Alberto Andújar Espinosa. I studied computer science and last year I did a master's degree in computer science. My master thesis obtained the highest mark. The work was about a mobile application and a web application designed to study active aging. From the technological point of view, the mobile application was developed using Ionic and the web application using AngularJS. So, I have solid knowledge of JavaScript, as well as, of its ecosystem. Currently, while I am studying this master's degree, I work as a freelance and I work everyday with the follow technologies NodeJS, MongoDB, AngularJS and Ionic.
I also have knowledge in CMS like Joomla, and in relational databases like MySql. In the same way I have experience managing sites, both on their own servers, as in full service platforms such as Azure or Digital Ocean.
I also have knowledge of C++ and Python, both I studied in bachelor and I have continued programming with these languages. In addition, by hobby I have done several courses in Udemy and CodeAcademy of both languages, especially I have been interested to know the syntactic advances of the new C++ compilers. On the other hand, I usually use Python, mainly as parser of .xml files or plain text files and also to make maintenance scripts on the servers.
I have worked with robotics frameworks and component oriented programming in both the bachelor and the master, although I do not have the same degree of experience as in the rest. I consider this GSoC an opportunity to deep into the knowledge of RoboComp and consequently in the robotics frameworks and I hope to draw conclusions about its differences with other alternatives such as the famous ROS.

## About the Project

My proposal is based on getting full support for JavaScript within the RoboComp framework. For this, the current state of generation of written components in the JavaScript language must be improved. Last year during the 2017 GSoC the functionality of the RoboComp component generator was extended to provide component supports based on NodeJS. A first approximation was achieved but still lacks robustness, reliability and should be extended to include more features. In addition, recently Zeroc ICE has added support for JavaScript interfaces, therefore the component generator must be extended to support this feature, both as a server and as a client. The component model of RoboComp must be able to generate components in this language with the same functionality as its counterparts in C ++ and Python, thus achieving complete support for JavaScript within RoboComp.

### Goals

- Understand the state of the current component generator and increase its robustness. 
- Study the support of Zeroc ICE for JavaScript. 
- Extract Zeroc ICE patterns to update JavaScript-based component generation templates 
- Update and extend the component generator code to achieve full integration of JavaScript.
