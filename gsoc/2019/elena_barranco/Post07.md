It’s been almost three months since Google Summer of Code started and we are now at the end of the work. We have focused primarily on debugging errors and  writing documentation these last days. A summary of the accomplished and pending tasks is listed below:

### Completed tasks
- Beta version of Robocompdsl-gui developed.
    - Full graphical interface design.
    - New interfaces management.
    - Main Robocompdsl operations.
    - Syntax highlighter.
    - Console to display information, warning and error messages.
    - Error highlighter (beta version).
    - Real-time parser (beta version).
- User guide created.

### Pendind tasks
- Errors related with the real-time parser have to be fixed, specifically for the block “options”. Other errors must be considered and handled
- Modules section must be developed and integrated in the graphical interface.
