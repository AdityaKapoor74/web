June 5, 2019

## About me :

Hi, I'm Liubove. I am a master student at the National Autonomous University of Mexico pursuing a Degree in Mathematics. I like Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence(AI) and I have experience in several projects related to these areas, ranging from speech-to-text implementations to the diagnosis of diseases through images.


## About the Project:

**Development of human activity recognition**

The task of recognizing and predicting human daily activities is a trending topic nowadays, and a lot of research has been developed around it, accompanied with the creation of algorithms that achieve state-of-the-art results on different human activity data sets. The application of a machine that can detect a personâ€™s actions is broad. It has been developed for gaming, Human-Computer interac-tion or Active and Assistive Living.

The project involves recognizing human activity from a RGB-D videos. The activities are: drinking water,  resting on couch, talking by phone, among others.
